### Capture information that will grow to 10 CB Units
- I will make sure that I keep up to date with the collegeboard videos
  - Keep my jupyter notebooks organized with approriate titles for studying
- Will make sure to stay on top of practice frq and mc quizzes each trimester
- Will use code.org and other resources to stay up to date in what we learn each week in class and become more profficient in Java

# As AP Test date gets closer I will:
- Reflect every month on what specific areas I need to strengthen
  - Will do this by giving myself quizzes and self assessing myself
- Practice MC questions
- Practice FRQs
- Take full practice tests
- Check over missed answers
