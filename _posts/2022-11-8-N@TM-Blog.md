# Pranav Night At The Museum Blog
- Image
- After going to the N@TM event, there were many takeaways I had
    - Firstly, many of the viewers(both parents and students) loved our interactive quiz due to the elaborate bank of questions we implemented and the styling on the page
    - We also received some feedback from peers to help us make our votes page look nicer, and also were given suggestions on what future pages we can implenet in our project from now on
    - Overall, I had a great time at the event and I hope to have a successful second trimester and become an overall better coder and student in AP CSA.
