<ul>
  <li>All successful people find ways to keep themselves under a good/calm state of mind in order to be the most effective in a work setting

</li>
  <li>Many people think that making mistakes and not succeeding at first is bad.
    <ul>
      <li>In reality, if you ask any successful person about failure, they will respond by saying that in order to succeed in life you must taste the defeat of failure</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>She also stated, that it is very important for people to reflect on the many different gifts we are given in life
    <ul>
      <li>Having a home, supportful parents, and access to clean food and water are some of the many examples that we need to be thankful for in life
        <ul>
          <li>In order to show our gratitude, we must take time atleast 5 mins a day in order to reflect on what we are thankful for each day cuz tommorow is never guaranteed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In addition, she also spoke about how we should make sure to let go of harships or fights that may have happened in the past with friends or family
    <ul>
      <li>She said this because at the end of the day, many of these fights are trivial and if something bad happens to anyone you will always bound up feeling regret for not letting go and apologizing/taking their apology
